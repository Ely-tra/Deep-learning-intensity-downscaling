# Deep learning tropical cyclone intensity
These deep-learning (DL) workflows are designed for retrieving, bias correcting, and downscaling tropical cyclone (TC) intensity from satellite imageries or climate reanalysis datasets. These models are developed in Chanh Kieu's TC research laboratory at Indiana University, Bloomington, as a part of an NSF-funded project (AGS \# 2309929). This repository was created and is currently maintained by Khanh Luong (email: kmluong@iu.edu).  

There are two main DL models supported here. One is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the other is based on the vision transformer (VIT). These models are implemented and tested specifically for the MERRA-2 dataset specifically on IU Big Red 200 supercomputer system. These models will be extended for other climate/global data in our future products. Any comments or questions about this project, please contact ckieu@iu.edu.
